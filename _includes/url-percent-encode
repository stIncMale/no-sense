  A percent-encoded tag (see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.1).

  The url_encode filter (https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/url_encode/)
  cannot be used as it appears to use application/x-www-form-urlencoded format
  (https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#application/x-www-form-urlencoded),
  which is not what I need.

  The escape filter (https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/escape/)
  cannot be used as it appears to encode with HTML character references
  (see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#character-references),
  which is not what I need.

  The uri_escape filter (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/) can and is used,
  but it does not encode reserved characters (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.2).
  Apparently, it was implemented this way to allow encoding a complete URI (not only its component
  parts) without messing up the URI in the process. While it may appear useful, it is actually an
  incorrect way to encode characters in URI. Instead, each component part must be encoded
  separately before they are combined in a complete URI by using reserved characters.
  As a result, I had to implement the percent encoding for reserved characters on my own.

  Make sure the content of this file does not end end with a newline character,
  otherwise including it does not work as intended, making the tags page to not working correctly.
