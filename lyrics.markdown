## [](#if){:.slink}If {#if}
If you can keep your head when all about you\\
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you\\
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\\
But make allowance for their doubting too;\\
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\\
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,\\
Or being hated, don't don't give way to hating,\\
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;\\
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;\\
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\\
And treat those two imposters just the same;\\
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\\
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\\
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\\
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;

If you can make one heap of all your winnings\\
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\\
And lose, and start again at your beginnings\\
And never breathe a word about your loss;\\
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\\
To serve your turn long after they are gone,\\
And so hold on when there is nothing in you\\
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\\
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,\\
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\\
If all men count with you, but none too much;\\
If you can fill the unforgiving minute\\
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,\\
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\\
And - which is more - you'll be a man, my son!

## [](#my-way){:.slink}My Way {#my-way}
And now, the end is near\\
And so I face the final curtain\\
My friend, I'll say it clear\\
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full\\
I've traveled each and every highway\\
And more, much more than this\\
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few\\
But then again, too few to mention\\
I did what I had to do\\
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course\\
Each careful step along the byway\\
And more, much more than this\\
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew\\
When I bit off more than I could chew\\
But through it all, when there was doubt\\
I ate it up and spit it out\\
I faced it all and I stood tall\\
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried\\
I've had my fill my share of losing\\
And now, as tears subside\\
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that\\
And may I say - not in a shy way\\
Oh no, oh no, not me\\
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?\\
If not himself, then he has naught\\
To say the things he truly feels\\
And not the words of one who kneels\\
The record shows I took the blows\\
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way

## [](#spring-is-long-gone){:.slink}Весна давно уж позади {#spring-is-long-gone}
Весна давно уж позади,\\
и лето жаркое далеко.\\
В осенний вечер не сиди\\
и не смотри на дождь из окон.

Войди в осинник золотой,\\
неторопливость увяданья\\
откроет вдруг перед тобой\\
природы честность и старанье.

Усталость легкую пойми,\\
ведь это вовсе не усталость,\\
а сожаленье, что с людьми\\
осталось быть такая малость.

Беда не в горести разлук,\\
не в смене ложи или крыши,\\
не в том, что слышен сердца стук,\\
а раньше ты его не слышал.

Не в том печаль, что рвется нить,\\
а ты в судьбе не наловчился,\\
а в том, что и любить и жить\\
ты так недавно научился.
