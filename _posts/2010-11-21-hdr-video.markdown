This tutorial presents a way[^1] to improve colors and enhance details in your video using HDR effect in Photomatix.
I used this technique in the game highlights video [No sense]({% post_url 2011-08-13-no-sense %}).

[^1]: The described process has some drawbacks because the effect was meant to be used on images instead of video:
    brightness flickering and sometimes other minor artifacts.
    Luckily, Photomatix Pro 4 has a new feature called exposure fusion.
    I found that one can get good results without artifacts when using exposure fusion instead of generating HDR image and then applying tone mapping.
