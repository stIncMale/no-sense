This is the very first attempt to create a game highlights video.
It was created with VirtualDubMod and Microsoft Paint, and looks quite naive. Good memories though &#x1f642;.
Unfortunately, I played Unreal Tournament 2004 offline, so all frags are on godlike bots.
This is unusual, and you can hardly find another UT2004 highlights video with bots.
