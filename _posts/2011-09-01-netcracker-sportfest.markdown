In 2011 I was employed with NetCracker Technology, and we had a very nice weekend called SportFest.
Unfortunately, there was no video taken, and all we had were photos.
I decided to use the photos and create this nifty video because <q>"life is about the people you meet, and the things you create with them"</q>.
