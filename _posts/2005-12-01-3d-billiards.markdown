*[MIPT]:
{:data-title="The Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology"}

This game is a computer science project made by students at MIPT.
The greater part of all programming was made by me with some help of [Roman Prokofyev](https://prokofyev.ch),
the model of a billiard table was made by Vladimir Muzychenko.
The game has tons of bugs, but somehow it works &#x1f605;

By the time I started this project, I had about 1.5&ndash;2 years of experience with computer;
before that I was not even able to copy a file in Windows.
Despite the game is quite poor, this page is here to keep memories about the very beginning of what later became my career.

Physics params are stored in `.\Data\Physical characteristics\VALUE.VAL` and one may play with them.

The process appears to not respond to input after starting. | Press `Esc` to close the splash screen.
The screen appears frozen after changing the display resolution. | `F1` loads default display settings. If this does not help, stop the process e.g. by pressing `Alt` + `F4` and launch it again.
I cannot see the menu/fonts in the game. | Maybe the required font is not installed. `F2` tries to load another font, `F3` loads the default game font.
