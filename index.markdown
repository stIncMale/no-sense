`Bio` | I was born in Belarus, moved to Moscow, Russia, where I studied at [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/) and got my **MSc degree in applied mathematics and physics**. Now I live in Calgary, Canada.

## [](#dead-code){:.slink}{{ site.custom_title }}
A place where I share things (mostly those related to my profession) with humanity.
Humanity&hellip; do I like it? Let's say, I have mixed feelings. I love [the song](https://youtu.be/0755SXCTCN0) though!

The story behind the name {{ site.custom_title }} is straightforward:
the majority of code that software engineers write in their spare time ends up being unused, i.e. being dead &mdash; hence the name.

## [](#personality){:.slink}Personality
This particular page is about sharing something with regard to my personality rather than technical things.
For example, here are a few examples of [lyrics]({% link lyrics.markdown %}) and quotes/sayings I like:
* <q>"...it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.
If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"</q>\\
<span class="small-font">Lewis Carroll, "Alice Through the Looking Glass", 1871</span>
* <q>"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."</q>\\
<span class="small-font">Benjamin Franklin, [Pennsylvania Assembly: Reply to the Governor](https://franklinpapers.org/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=6&page=238a), November 11, 1755</span>
* <q>"Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig."</q>\\
<span class="small-font">Robert A. Heinlein, "Time Enough for Love", 1973</span>
* <q>"When the going gets tough, the tough get going."</q>\\
<span class="small-font">this saying [is ridiculously interpreted](https://youtu.be/z52kKE8qngs) in South Park s16e7</span>
* <q>"Do your duty, come what may."</q>
* <q>"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."</q>

I like to play computer games and spent a lot of time playing Quake and Unreal Tournament series.
I also was taking part for 3 years in developing (unfortunately mobile) games at [ZeptoLab](https://youtu.be/mAXjQvJ2Umo).
My nickname is `Male` sometimes with the tag `stInc`.
This tag is now quite useless because I suppose I am the only one who still uses it.
`stInc` means `Starfuckers Inc`, or sometimes it may mean "stink" &#x1f61b;
