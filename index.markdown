`Bio` | I was born in Mogilev, Belarus, moved to Moscow, Russia, where I studied at [MIPT] and got my **MSc in applied mathematics and physics**. Now I live in Calgary, Canada.

## [](#dead-code){:.section-link}{{ site.custom_title }}
A place where I share things (mostly those related to my profession) with humanity.
Humanity&hellip; do I like it? Let's say, I have mixed feelings. I love [the song](https://youtu.be/0755SXCTCN0) though!

The story behind the name {{ site.custom_title }} is straightforward:
the majority of code that software engineers write in their spare time ends up being unused, i.e. being dead&mdash;hence the name.

## [](#personality){:.section-link}Personality
This particular page is about sharing something with regard to my personality rather than technical things.
For example, here are a few examples of [lyrics]({% link lyrics.markdown %}) and quotes/sayings I like:
* <q>"...it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.[^1] If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"</q>\\
  <span class="insignificant">Lewis Carroll, [Through the looking-glass, and what Alice found there](https://www.loc.gov/item/00000848/), 1871</span>
* <q>"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."</q>\\
  <span class="insignificant">Benjamin Franklin, [Pennsylvania Assembly: Reply to the Governor](https://franklinpapers.org/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=6&page=238a), November 11, 1755</span>
* <q>"Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig."</q>\\
  <span class="insignificant">Robert A. Heinlein, [Time enough for love, the lives of Lazarus Long](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=72098131&searchType=1&permalink=y), 1973</span>
* <q>"When the going gets tough, the tough get going."</q>\\
  <span class="insignificant">this saying [is ridiculously interpreted](https://youtu.be/z52kKE8qngs) in [South Park s16e7](https://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s16e07-cartman-finds-love)</span>
* <q>"Do your duty, come what may."</q>
* <q>"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."</q>

I like to play computer games and spent a lot of time playing Quake and Unreal Tournament series.
I also was taking part for 3 years in developing (unfortunately mobile) games at [ZeptoLab](https://youtu.be/mAXjQvJ2Umo).
My nickname is `Male` sometimes with the tag `stInc`.
This tag is now quite useless because I suppose I am the only one who still uses it.
`stInc` means `Starfuckers Inc`, or sometimes it may mean "stink" &#x1f61b;

[^1]: Albert Einstein went even further than Lewis Carroll in his general theory of relativity, which tells us that in curved spacetime a body must
    have non-zero proper acceleration (it may be measured by an accelerometer) to stay in the same place.
    See [Is Gravity An Illusion? (at 9:56)](https://youtu.be/XRr1kaXKBsU?t=596)<span class="insignificant">&nbsp;by [Derek Muller](https://www.veritasium.com)</span>
    for a popular science explanation.
