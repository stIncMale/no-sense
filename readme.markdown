# My personal website

## Tech stack
The source code is written with
* [Jekyll extension](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) of [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template language
* [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) markup language
that is based on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and is converted into HTML
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) ([SCSS syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss)) stylesheet language that is converted into [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/JavaScript_technologies_overview)

and then transformed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site generator into files ready to be served by a web server.
This transformation is done automatically by GitHub when a new commit is pushed to the repository and the result is hosted by
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).

I do not use any [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) of those [supported by GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/themes/),
so everything is written from scratch. Creating this website was a useful exercise for me as I am a server-side software engineer
with a very limited knowledge of front-end technologies.  

## History
Originally my personal website <https://sites.google.com/site/aboutmale/> was hosted by classic Google Sites,
but those are deprecated and just like the [new Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new) did not allow full control over layout, styles and scripts,
while with GitHub Pages I have full control over those things.

## Misc
The original GitHub URL <https://stincmale.github.io> is redirected to the canonical URL <https://www.kovalenko.link>.
